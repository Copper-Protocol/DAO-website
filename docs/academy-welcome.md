## About

The TokenEngineering Academy (TE Academy) offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for anyone interested in this new, emerging field. We invite individuals and project teams to learn, collaborate, and put token engineering into practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy: <contact@tokenengineering.net>. 


## RAI Workshop - Modeling the Money God
![RAI_Workshop](/img/RAI_WS.jpg)

_**The Token Engineering Academy is partnering with Reflexer Labs and BlockScience to host a 3-session workshop on the RAI protocol cadCAD digital twin.**_  

The recently open sourced model is ripe for exploration and tinkering. These workshops will cover an introduction to the RAI Protocol and a walk-through on how to execute & modify the model itself. 

**Session 1 - Thursday, November 4th, 2021 @ 4pm CET**  
Introduction to RAI & Operational Digital Twins,  
and how to run the RAI digital twin model

**Session 2 - Thursday, November 11th 2021 @ 4pm CET**  
Understanding the RAI Digital Twin,  
walkthrough data inputs / outputs, and model execution cycle

**Session 3 - Thursday, November 18th 2021 @ 4pm CET**  
Leveraging the RAI Digital Twin,  
changing the cadCAD model parameters and introducing the behavioral model

## DAO Rewards Systems
![Rewards Systems](/img/RewardsSystems_form.jpg)

_**A Governauts #OpenScience initiative for TokenEngineers & DAOists in collaboration with [OceanDAO](https://oceanprotocol.com/dao) and [Boson Protocol](https://www.bosonprotocol.io/) - apply and come on board as a community co-researcher, or attend our open lectures!**_

Today, more and more blockchain projects are relying on decentralized governance as the form of decision-making for their protocol. This means handing power to tokenholders, delegates, or even joining forces and voting with other DAOs.

While this is an exciting trend, we're also faced with new challenges like defining effective voting mechanisms, maximizing community participation, or fighting voter fraud. To tackle these challenges, we need experts in Token Engineering - the Governauts, as we are shaping a new [social reality](https://medium.com/block-science/algorithms-as-policy-44e289d34a65).

**The Governauts Rewards Systems Research Initiative is a 3-months program to explore incentives in a DAO context.**

Rewards Systems are a key element for DAOs to grow the ecosystem value, reward contributors, and grant decision-making power (governance tokens) to those who provide value to a DAO.

In this program, we'll explore different DAO cases, analyze data, design mechanism improvements and verify our assumptions with experiments in real-DAO environments.

Here's what you can expect:

- get an in-depth introduction to various DAO rewards systems in production, and discuss with DAO stakeholders
- learn to explore DAO data and verify our assumptions about DAO contributors
- meet other Governauts and collaborate on new token-based compensation mechanisms  
- learn how to model rewards systems and apply your cadCAD skills!

**This is a multidisciplinary program!** We welcome co-researchers from many fields, like behavioral economics, (computational) psychology, sociology, game design, engineering, math, data analytics or computer science - and of course: DAOists!  

**Start:** Tuesday, Nov 16, 2021  
**End:** Thursday, Feb 24, 2022  
**Duration:** 12 weeks  

**Time investment:** ~15 hours/week on average  
**Skills:** Data Analysis, Python, Math & Statistics, cadCAD, and/or tokenSPICE most welcome, but not mandatory  
**Format:** online/live    

**Registration:** The number of participants in this program is limited. Please apply [here](https://forms.gle/VMvjoXAYmQWkedPn9).  
**Registration deadline:** Sunday, Nov 7, 2021 - 11:59 pm UTC  

**Events:** We run a series of talks and open lectures as part of this research initiative program that is open to anyone interested. Stay tuned for our program announcements via the Governauts on [Twitter](https://Twitter.com/GovernanceDAO) or [Telegram](https://t.me/GovCommons).


## OMNIPool Engineering and Simulations

> A collaboration of 
> **[HydraDX](https://hydradx.io/)**, **[BlockScience](https://block.science/)** and TE Academy

[HydraDX](https://hydradx.io/) is a cross-chain liquidity protocol managing all assets in one shared liquidity pool. It is powered by Substrate and designed to be interoperable with other networks, including Ethereum-based assets.

HydraDX is being built under a rigorous engineering process, collaborating with [BlockScience](https://block.science/), whose work includes the design and evaluation of economic and ecosystem models based on simulation and analysis. They bring deep expertise in Token Engineering R&D and have pioneered cadCAD - an open-source Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing, and validating complex systems through simulation.

This research group aims to onboard aspiring token engineers to this development process. Together, we’ll create new insights, develop simulation infrastructure, and validate design choices — accessible and re-usable for the entire DeFi ecosystem.

**What you can expect**
* start with an introduction to... 
* Hydra AMMs and the liquidity subsystem
* the engineering process and system design
* Generalized Dynamical Systems (state representation, actions, policies, and behaviors)
* mathematical system specification and reference implementations
* Parameter Selection under Uncertainty
* choose your research question, and team up with co-researchers with complementary skills
* use cadCAD and translate your research direction to simulation code step-by-step
* get regular feedback and discuss your work with BlockScience mentors and HydraDX team

**Start:** Thursday, August 5, 2021  
**End:** Thursday, October 28, 2021  
**Duration:** 12 weeks  
**Time investment:** min. 10 hours/week, 2-3 meetings per week 

**Skills:** Python, cadCAD, solid understanding of AMMs  
**Background:** Ideally, you have an educational background in finance, economics, math, engineering, machine learning, or computer science. Additionally, we are open to participants from other disciplines, in particular social sciences. 

**Format:** online/live  
**Fee:** free  
**Number of participants:** max. 25  

**Registration:** Applications are closed now but our [sessions are open](https://discord.gg/UEBQUmAg7q), feel free to drop by and listen in!

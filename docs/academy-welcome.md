## About

The TokenEngineering Academy (TE Academy) offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for anyone interested in this new, emerging field. We invite individuals and teams to learn, collaborate, and put token engineering into practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy: <contact@tokenengineering.net>.  


## Balancer Simulations Research Group

> A collaboration of  
> **[Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) and TE Academy**

Since its inception in 2020, [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) has become one of the most important building blocks in DeFi. With the launch of V2 in April 2021, Balancer keeps [pushing the boundaries](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v2-generalizing-amms-16343c4563ff) of programmable liquidity and customizable AMM logic. Weighted pools, stable pools, adaptive smart pools and new, resilient price oracles will enable a whole new layer of DeFi use cases.

Balancer and TE Academy aim to establish a network of researchers to leverage the full power of Balancer Pools and AMMs in general. With this research group we contribute to open-source infrastructure and knowledge for rigorous Token Engineering in the DeFi space. We are looking for co-researchers from a wide range of backgrounds to join this group and participate in Balancer #OpenScience. 

**What you can expect**
- start with a structured onboarding to Balancer algorithms and simulations
- choose your research question, and team up with co-researchers with complementary skills
- get regular feedback and discuss your work with DeFi and token engineering peers
- get access to DeFi projects and work on bounties or grants  

**Start:** Thursday, April 29, 2021  
**End:**  Wednesday, July 28, 2021  
**Duration:** 12 weeks  
**Time investment:** min. 10 hours/week  

**Skills:** Python, Math & Statistics, Balancer Pools/AMMs and [cadCAD Foundations Bootcamp](https://www.cadcad.education) (free online course)  
**Background:** Ideally, you have a background in finance, economics, math, engineering, machine learning or computer science. Additionally, we are open to participants from other disciplines, like social sciences. If you are keen to be part of Balancer research and development, apply!

## Ecosystem Value Flows

This course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase in Token Model Generation consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We'll start with canvases familiar to business and product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [value flow](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.  

Course Structure:  
Module 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members  
Module 2: Incentives  
Module 3: Games for Token Economy Co-Creation  
Module 4: Value Flows  
Module 5: Governance  

With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of the Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms.  

**Start date:** Thursday, May 6, 2021  
**End date:** Friday, May 28, 2021  
**Time investment:** 15-20 hours per week, according to to self-defined learning goals and modules selected 

**Fees:**  
**Teams:** 560 USD/DAI + VAT (come with up to 3 team members, work on your own project case)  
**Individuals:** 280 USD/DAI + VAT (join a team, work on a 3rd party case)

## Gitcoin Grants Research Group 

> A collaboration of  
> **[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), [BlockScience](https://block.science/), [TE Commons](https://tecommons.org/) and TE Academy**  

Measuring peoples' aggregated preferences to steer [public goods funding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) is a challenge that can't be solved by traditional voting systems or markets.  
Quadratic Voting combines signals of individual preference *and* influence for an aggregated voting result - and thus is much better suited to make public decisions.
No wonder it captured the hearts of the web3 space after being re-introduced by the [Radical xChange movement](https://www.radicalxchange.org/).

[Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) builds on the same principle by leveraging a powerful algorithmic policy called [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000) (QF) to allocate sponsor funds via matching community donations to grants submitted through the Gitcoin Grants program. 

While QF is very powerful, it is sensitive to [Sybil Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting#Sybil_Attacks) and collusion strategies. Furthermore, like many social systems, it has been observed to exhibit the [Matthew Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect), a runaway effect of 'the rich get richer', which needs careful consideration in sustainable systems design.

This is why Gitcoin, TE Academy and [BlockScience](https://block.science/), a leading engineering, R&D, and analytics firm specializing in complex systems, started a collaboration. The goal is to [investigate the design of data-driven policy tools](https://medium.com/block-science/towards-computer-aided-governance-of-gitcoin-grants-730de7bcdbef) that can better respond to [QF sensitivities](https://medium.com/block-science/colluding-communities-or-new-markets-f64194a1b754).  
Moreover, the project aims to analyze emergent social dynamics and network formation to develop new algorithmic governance designs to secure the Gitcoin Grants ecosystem's healthiness.

**In this research group, you'll**
* start with a structured onboarding program
* define and work on your own research question
* analyze user behavior and social dynamics based on real user data
* attend [Gitcoin Modelling Co-Lab](https://www.notion.so/Gitcoin-Modelling-Co-Lab-TL-DR-dba6e25863a1413a81e75f989f4a1f67) sessions with BlockScience and Gitcoin
* get feedback and input from key researchers in the field

We are looking for participants from a wide range of backgrounds: economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics, and computer science.
If you are keen to contribute to the progress of Quadratic Funding, don't miss this chance and apply now!

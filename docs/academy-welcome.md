# About

The TokenEngineering Academy (TE Academy) offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for anyone interested in this new, emerging field. We invite individuals and project teams to learn, collaborate, and put token engineering into practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy: <contact@tokenengineering.net>.  


# Engineering dCommerce

> A collaboration of  
> **[Boson Protocol](https://bosonprotocol.io) and TE Academy**

Today, eCommerce happens within closed, monopolized digital platforms. What could those platforms look like if they were founded on permissionless, decentralized protocols? [Boson Protocol](https://www.bosonprotocol.io) is calling this radical, new proposition dCommerce, and we believe its challenges and opportunities are on the leading edge of our Token Engineering field. 

Building the #dCommerce ecosystem requires more than great minds. It calls for applied knowledge, multidisciplinary collaboration, and a community of builders and researchers from [#eCommerce](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eCommerce?src=hashtag_click) to [#Web3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hashtag_click) coming together to develop such complex yet robust crypto-economic systems.

Engineering dCommerce is a program that gathers exceptional contributors, researchers, and protocols to be catalysts and pioneers of this liminal new field of work. Join us for educational sessions, workshops, and updates on Token Engineering research in this sector.

We invite participants from various backgrounds such as e-commerce, data science and analytics, marketing, digital product, operations and fulfillment, and business finance. This program is the perfect starting point for digital pros looking to enter crypto and build the future of commerce.

Do you have an engineering and/or economics background, or even first experience in Token Engineering? Great, join Engineering dCommerce and put your skills to work in a field that impacts the lives of many.

# Balancer Simulations Research Group

> A collaboration of  
> **[Balancer](https://balancer.finance/)** and TE Academy, 
as well as [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) and [Powerpool](https://powerpool.finance) as project partners.

Since its inception in 2020, [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) has become one of the most important building blocks in DeFi. With the launch of V2 in April 2021, Balancer keeps [pushing the boundaries](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v2-generalizing-amms-16343c4563ff) of programmable liquidity and customizable AMM logic. Weighted pools, stable pools, adaptive smart pools and new, resilient price oracles will enable a whole new layer of DeFi use cases.

Balancer and TE Academy aim to establish a network of researchers to leverage the full power of Balancer Pools and AMMs in general. With this research group we contribute to open-source infrastructure and knowledge for rigorous Token Engineering in the DeFi space. We are looking for co-researchers from a wide range of backgrounds to join this group and participate in Balancer #OpenScience. 

**What you can expect**
- start with a structured onboarding to Balancer algorithms and simulations
- choose your research question, and team up with co-researchers with complementary skills
- get regular feedback and discuss your work with DeFi and token engineering peers
- get access to DeFi projects and work on bounties or grants  

**Start:** Thursday, April 29, 2021  
**End:**  Wednesday, July 28, 2021  
**Duration:** 12 weeks  
**Time investment:** min. 10 hours/week  

**Skills:** Python, Math & Statistics, Balancer Pools/AMMs and [cadCAD Foundations Bootcamp](https://www.cadcad.education) (free online course)  
**Background:** Ideally, you have a background in finance, economics, math, engineering, machine learning or computer science. Additionally, we are open to participants from other disciplines, like social sciences. If you are keen to be part of Balancer research and development, apply!  

**Format:** online/live  
**Registration:** Applications are closed - we invite anyone interested to follow our open working sessions and presentations. Find our session [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=NThubWhyaXNjYzc3bWVrbWU2YTMxNWJzY29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) here.  
**Fee:** free - stake on participation  


# Ecosystem Value Flows

This course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase in Token Model Generation consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We'll start with canvases familiar to business and product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [value flow](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.  

Course Structure:  
Module 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members  
Module 2: Incentives  
Module 3: Games for Token Economy Co-Creation  
Module 4: Value Flows  
Module 5: Governance  

With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of the Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms.  

**Start date:** Thursday, May 6, 2021  
**End date:** Friday, May 28, 2021  
**Time investment:** 15-20 hours per week, according to to self-defined learning goals and modules selected 

**Registration:**  
Applications for this cohort are closed.
In case you are interested to take part in the next cohort, please [register here](https://forms.gle/qPs7BCjh4tAADpfV7) and we'll inform you as soon as we open up applications again. 

**Format:** live sessions, online content, mentoring sessions & feedback rounds

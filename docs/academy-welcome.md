## TokenEngineering Academy

The TokenEngineering Academy offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for everyone interested in this emerging field.
We welcome crypto teams who aim to establish a proper token engineering practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy or collaborate with our students: <contact@tokenengineering.net>.  

## Hacking cadCAD Models

cadCAD is an open-source Python package for designing, testing, and validating cryptoeconomic systems. With a growing number of open-source models available, it provides a comprehensive toolset for Token Engineering.
Computational models enable crypto projects to analyse particular scenarios, detect weaknesses, and stress-test a system design through simulations.

**We’d like to inspire you to become computational explorers!**  
This course will train you to work with models.
You will learn how easy it is to experiment and modify cadCAD models, understand the rationale of a model design, develop alternatives – and how this fits into the Token Engineering iterative process.

**The schedule (tentative):**  
**Introduction**  
Introduction to Model Recycling: An ode towards the Computational Explorer.  
**Part I:**  
Why build simple models from scratch if we can complexify existing ones? A showcase of what we have right now.  
Complexifying the Prey and Predator Model.  
**Part II:**  
Complicating existing models through stochastic processes  
Introducing Human Error on the Uniswap model.  
**Part III:**  
Building an Internet of Models through IoT and web scraping  
Making a social oracle with the Conviction Voting model  
**Part IV:**  
Plugging model parametrizations with Machine Learning  
Predicting atmosphere dynamics with cadCAD  
**Presentations:**  
Final project presentations  

**Location:** online course, live  
**Number of participants:** up to 30  

This course is going to take place in Feb/March 2021. In case you are interested in taking part, please register here, and we’ll inform you once the course is live: https://forms.gle/jK8AxoqqDkcGQdB59

## Ecosystem Value Flows

This course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase in Token Model Generation consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We'll start with canvases familiar to business and product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for value flow visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [Stocks & Flows](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.  
The course has the following structure:  
Part 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members  
Part 2: Stakeholder Interactions & Motives  
Part 3: Games & Governance  
Part 4: Value Network Specification (adapted Stock & Flow)  
With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of the Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms. You or your technical counterpart can then specify the dynamic model further using [Differential Specification Syntax](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31) and simulate using [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/). If you are not familiar with systems modeling and systems dynamics, this course is a prerequisite.     

**Start date/End date:**  
To be announced  

**Registration:  
The next cohort of Ecosystem Value Flows will start in Feb/March 2021. We'll open applications around 4 weeks beforehand.

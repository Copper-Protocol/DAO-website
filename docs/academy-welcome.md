## About

The TokenEngineering Academy (TE Academy) offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for anyone interested in this new, emerging field. We invite individuals and project teams to learn, collaborate, and put token engineering into practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy: <contact@tokenengineering.net>. 

## Incubating Governauts

Today, more and more blockchain projects are relying on decentralized governance as the form of decision-making for their protocol. This means handing power to tokenholders, delegates, or even joining forces and voting with other DAOs.

While this is an exciting trend, we're also faced with new challenges like defining effective voting mechanisms, maximizing community participation, or fighting voter fraud.  
To tackle these challenges, we need experts in Token Engineering.
Here, we can draw from fields like Mechanism Design, Operations Research, Psychology, Decisions Science, and Political Science. We can apply data analytics, ML, simulations and formulate accountability feedback loops as we are shaping a new [social reality](https://medium.com/block-science/algorithms-as-policy-44e289d34a65). 

**Incubating the Governauts is an initiative to establish a new branch in Token Engineering, focusing on governance.** 

Our roadmap:  
Phase 1 - Gaining Community Support  
We start with a [Gitcoin proposal](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2978/incubating-governauts). If you think we need Governauts, or want to become one yourself - show your support, and join our [events](https://twitter.com/governancedao) to discuss today's challenges and most exciting projects.

Phase 2 - Select Cases & Fundraising  
Let’s solve problems! We’ll collaborate with a couple of DAOs, work on cases and create tangible examples for Governautical superpowers.

Phase 3 - Growing the Governauts  
Come on board! We’ll open up our activities to a wider community and work together in research groups coming up with new solutions for crypto governance.

**Pre-Registration:**  
Want to participate in research groups? Excited to learn more about #tokenengineering for governance?  
We are looking for participants from a variety of backgrounds, like systems engineering, data science, political science, and more.
[Sign-up here](https://forms.gle/zNNLdi8aUKystz3QA), and receive an invitation once we open up applications for phase 3!

**Events:**  
We run a series of events leading towards the research group. Join us for talks. discussions and workshops!  

Friday, Aug 13, 3:00 pm UTC  
MEET THE GOVERNAUTS - Open co-programming

Friday, Sep 10, 3:00 pm UTC

You can find all Governauts events at this [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y19nYmU0Y2JwaWhqaHRybGRiamIwOWw2Mzdzb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).





## Engineering dCommerce

> A collaboration of  
> **[Boson Protocol](https://bosonprotocol.io) and TE Academy**

Today, eCommerce happens within closed, monopolized digital platforms. What could those platforms look like if they were founded on permissionless, decentralized protocols? [Boson Protocol](https://www.bosonprotocol.io) is calling this radical, new proposition dCommerce, and we believe its challenges and opportunities are on the leading edge of our Token Engineering field. 

Building the #dCommerce ecosystem requires more than great minds. It calls for applied knowledge, multidisciplinary collaboration, and a community of builders and researchers from [#eCommerce](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eCommerce?src=hashtag_click) to [#Web3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hashtag_click) coming together to develop such complex yet robust crypto-economic systems.

Engineering dCommerce is a program that gathers exceptional contributors, researchers, and protocols to be catalysts and pioneers of this liminal new field of work. Join us for educational sessions, workshops, and updates on Token Engineering research in this sector.

We invite participants from various backgrounds such as e-commerce, data science and analytics, marketing, digital product, operations and fulfillment, and business finance. This program is the perfect starting point for digital pros looking to enter crypto and build the future of commerce.
Do you have an engineering and/or economics background, or even first experience in Token Engineering? Great, join Engineering dCommerce and put your skills to work in a field that impacts the lives of many.

**Registration:**
[Register here](https://forms.gle/g3L5WBLCRZLp7ezu8) to participate in our sessions and further activities we’ll roll out in the course of 2021.  
**Application deadline:** Friday August 27, 2021, at 6:00 pm CEST  
**Fee:** free


## OMNIPool Engineering and Simulations

> A collaboration of 
> **[HydraDX](https://hydradx.io/)**, **[BlockScience](https://block.science/)** and TE Academy

[HydraDX](https://hydradx.io/) is a cross-chain liquidity protocol managing all assets in one shared liquidity pool. It is powered by Substrate and designed to be interoperable with other networks, including Ethereum-based assets.

HydraDX is being built under a rigorous engineering process, collaborating with [BlockScience](https://block.science/), whose work includes the design and evaluation of economic and ecosystem models based on simulation and analysis. They bring deep expertise in Token Engineering R&D and have pioneered cadCAD - an open-source Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing, and validating complex systems through simulation.

This research group aims to onboard aspiring token engineers to this development process. Together, we’ll create new insights, develop simulation infrastructure, and validate design choices — accessible and re-usable for the entire DeFi ecosystem.

**What you can expect**
* start with an introduction to... 
* Hydra AMMs and the liquidity subsystem
* the engineering process and system design
* Generalized Dynamical Systems (state representation, actions, policies, and behaviors)
* mathematical system specification and reference implementations
* Parameter Selection under Uncertainty
* choose your research question, and team up with co-researchers with complementary skills
* use cadCAD and translate your research direction to simulation code step-by-step
* get regular feedback and discuss your work with BlockScience mentors and HydraDX team

## Ecosystem Value Flows

This course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase in Token Model Generation consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We'll start with canvases familiar to business and product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [value flow](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.  

Course Structure:  
Module 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members  
Module 2: Incentives  
Module 3: Games for Token Economy Co-Creation  
Module 4: Value Flows  
Module 5: Governance  

With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of the Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms.  

**Time investment:** 15-20 hours per week, according to to self-defined learning goals and modules selected 

**Registration:**  
Round 3 of Ecosystem Value Flows took place in May 2021. The start date of the next cohort is not defined, yet.
In case you are interested to take part in the next cohort, please [register here](https://forms.gle/qPs7BCjh4tAADpfV7) and we'll inform you as soon as we open up applications again. 

**Format:** live sessions, online content, mentoring sessions & feedback rounds

## About

The TokenEngineering Academy (TE Academy) offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for anyone interested in this new, emerging field. We invite individuals and project teams to learn, collaborate, and put token engineering into practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy: <contact@tokenengineering.net>.  

## Engineering dCommerce

> A collaboration of  
> **[Boson Protocol](https://bosonprotocol.io) and TE Academy**

Today, eCommerce happens within closed, monopolized digital platforms. What could those platforms look like if they were founded on permissionless, decentralized protocols? [Boson Protocol](https://www.bosonprotocol.io) is calling this radical, new proposition dCommerce, and we believe its challenges and opportunities are on the leading edge of our Token Engineering field. 

Building the #dCommerce ecosystem requires more than great minds. It calls for applied knowledge, multidisciplinary collaboration, and a community of builders and researchers from [#eCommerce](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eCommerce?src=hashtag_click) to [#Web3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hashtag_click) coming together to develop such complex yet robust crypto-economic systems.

Engineering dCommerce is a program that gathers exceptional contributors, researchers, and protocols to be catalysts and pioneers of this liminal new field of work. Join us for educational sessions, workshops, and updates on Token Engineering research in this sector.

We invite participants from various backgrounds such as e-commerce, data science and analytics, marketing, digital product, operations and fulfillment, and business finance. This program is the perfect starting point for digital pros looking to enter crypto and build the future of commerce.

Do you have an engineering and/or economics background, or even first experience in Token Engineering? Great, join Engineering dCommerce and put your skills to work in a field that impacts the lives of many.

## Ocean Markets @ Balancer Simulations

> A collaboration of  
> **[Balancer](https://balancer.finance/)**, **[Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com)** and TE Academy.

Since its inception in 2020, Balancer has become one of the most important building blocks in DeFi. With the launch of V2 in April 2021, Balancer keeps pushing the boundaries of programmable liquidity and customizable AMM logic. 

As a challenge partner for Balancer Simulations, [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) will collaborate with researchers to study agent-based models of the Web3 data economy. The researchers will use [TokenSPICE](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tokenspice2) agent-based simulation with EVM-in-the-loop. Using EVM enables perfect-fidelity models of Balancer V1 and V2 contracts. These models interact with Python-based agents for data suppliers, data consumers, data stakers and speculators. Researchers can compare one-sided with two-sided data staking, model the effect of liquidity mining and other incentives on data supply or demand, and compare Dutch Auctions versus Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools for Initial Data Offerings (IDOs). The results will be accessible and re-usable for the Balancer, Ocean, and Token Engineering communities.

We are looking for co-researchers from a wide range of backgrounds to join this group, to learn and participate!

**What you can expect**
* start with a structured onboarding to Balancer algorithms and simulations
* choose your research question, and team up with co-researchers with complementary skills
* use [TokenSPICE](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tokenspice2) and try simulation approaches with EVM in the loop
* get regular feedback and discuss your work with Ocean Protocol and token engineering peers
* be well-positioned for ongoing funding from OceanDAO for further Token Engineering research  

**Start:** Friday, June 11, 2021  
**End:**  Wednesday, July 28, 2021  
**Duration:** 7 weeks  
**Time investment:** min. 10 hours/week  

**Skills:** Python, Math & Statistics, solid understanding Balancer Pools/AMMs and smart contracts  
**Background:** Ideally, you have a background in finance, economics, math, engineering, machine learning, or computer science. Additionally, we are open to participants from other disciplines, like social sciences. If you are keen to be part of Balancer research and development, apply! 

**Format:** online/live  
**Fee:** free - stake on participation 

**Registration:** Applications are closed now but our [sessions are open](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=NThubWhyaXNjYzc3bWVrbWU2YTMxNWJzY29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ), feel free to drop by and listen in! 


## Introduction to Token Engineering

## Ecosystem Value Flows

This course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase in Token Model Generation consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We'll start with canvases familiar to business and product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [value flow](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.  

Course Structure:  
Module 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members  
Module 2: Incentives  
Module 3: Games for Token Economy Co-Creation  
Module 4: Value Flows  
Module 5: Governance  

With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of the Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms.  

**Time investment:** 15-20 hours per week, according to to self-defined learning goals and modules selected 

**Registration:**  
Round 3 of Ecosystem Value Flows took place in May 2021. The start date of the next cohort is not defined, yet.
In case you are interested to take part in the next cohort, please [register here](https://forms.gle/qPs7BCjh4tAADpfV7) and we'll inform you as soon as we open up applications again. 

**Format:** live sessions, online content, mentoring sessions & feedback rounds
